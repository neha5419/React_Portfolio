          I’m a passionate web developer with experience in creating dynamic and
          responsive websites. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning
          ideas into reality through code. I hold a BSc in Computer Science and
          an MCA, which have equipped me with a solid understanding of
          programming and web technologies. My expertise includes working with
          technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS.
          <br></br><br>
          </br>
          In addition to my technical skills, I’m committed to writing clean,
          efficient code and following best practices in software development.
          When I’m not coding, you might find me exploring the latest design
          trends or contributing to open-source projects.
